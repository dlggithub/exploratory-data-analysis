EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT 1 
FORK LOCATED IN MASTER diggithub

Introduction

The following is assignment project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis.  The dataset used in the analysis is the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" located in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).  All missing data is coded as ?.

The overall goal of the project is to analyze variable energy usage over a 2 day period between dates 2007-02-01 to 2007-02-02.  The analysis results will be reflected in four png plots and all data will be placed in github.  Each plot should be saved as a png and have width of 480 pixels and height of 480 pixels, code that produces the png and reads the original file listed above.  

Original Codes

The variables collected are from one household sampled every minute over approximately 4 years.  Descriptions and codes for the variables are listed below. 

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
